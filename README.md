# intro_haskell_programming

I taught the course COP4020 Programming Languages in Fall 2016. I used Haskell to introduce undergraduate students to functional programming. 

I decided to upload all materials to this repo to have all my code on GitHub.

I like the book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).
