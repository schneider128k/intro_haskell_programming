# intro_haskell_programming

I taught the course COP4020 Programming Languages in Fall 2016. I used Haskell to introduce undergraduate students to functional programming. 

I decided to upload all materials to this repo to have all my code on GitHub. The original course repo is [https://bitbucket.org/schneider128k/2016_fall_cop4020](https://bitbucket.org/schneider128k/2016_fall_cop4020).

I also taught this course in Spring 2016. In addition to Haskell, I also introduced Prolog. The course materials are in [https://bitbucket.org/schneider128k/2016_spring_cop4020](https://bitbucket.org/schneider128k/2016_spring_cop4020).

I like the introductory book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).
